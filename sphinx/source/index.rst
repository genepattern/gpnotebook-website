**GenePattern Notebook** is the first system to integrate the dynamic capabilities of notebook systems with an investigator-focused, easy-to-use interface that provides access to hundreds of genomic tools without the need to write code.

Furthermore, GenePattern Notebook enhances the user experience by providing additional services such as, **the Python UIBuilder**, which converts any python function into an interative widget, and **a Rich text editor**, which allows a user to format notes and documentation in a notebook in much the same way that one might use Microsoft Word or Libre Office
